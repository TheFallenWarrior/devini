List of TODO things for Devini:

* Read some C specifications to see what the hell's going on /

* Move <sys/*> folder into <kernel/*> +

* Move sysroot/lib/kernel/ into src/kernel/

* Write other basic libc headers/libraries:
	stdint.h /
	stdbool.h +
	math.h
	assert.h +
	stddef.h
	stdarg.h
	string.h /
	...

* Finish reorganizing source tree || library trees /

* Add a kernel entry-point that calls main()

* Reformat the code for readability || add comments /

* Add suport for C++ on the header files: /
	#ifdef __cplusplus
	extern "C" {
	#endif
	...
	#ifdef __cplusplus
	}
	#endif

* Implement GDT, IRQs IRSs and other P R O T E C T E D  M O D E stuff

* Implement a basic PS/2 keyboard driver, along with getc() and gets() implementations

* Write a printf() function and set the code free from puts()'s evil dictatorship

* Finish stdio.h (except for that file I/O part)

* (MAYBE) Write a PS/2 mouse driver (or you could just tab your way through)

* (MAYBE) Add floppy/hard disk support and FAT12/16/32 drivers

* (MAYBE) Add a UNIX-like virtual filesystem

* (MAYBE) Make it portable to ARM (should have been working on it from the begining)
